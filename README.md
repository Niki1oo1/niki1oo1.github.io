# Nikola Veselinov

I’m a software developer interested in simplicity, correctness, and thoughtful systems.

I care about building things that work well and make sense. I like writing clean code, learning how systems behave under pressure, and keeping my tools lightweight. I’m especially curious about compilers, infrastructure, and programming languages.

This site is a small space to share projects, notes, and whatever else seems worth writing down.

## Projects

A few things I’ve worked on:

- **[Tiny Compiler](#)** — A toy language that compiles to x86-64 assembly. Built from scratch to learn more about parsing and codegen.
- **[Static Site Generator](#)** — A minimal Jekyll-like static generator written in Python.
- **[More on GitHub →](https://github.com/NikolaVeselinov)**

## Notes

Sometimes I write about things I find interesting:

- **[Making Things Simple](#)** — Thoughts on why simplicity beats cleverness.
- **[Zero-Cost Abstractions?](#)** — When abstractions are worth it, and when they aren’t.
- **[How I Use Git](#)** — A few tricks for keeping repos tidy and commits meaningful.

These are mostly informal — part logbook, part sandbox.
