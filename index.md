I’m a software developer, researcher, and writer with interests in programming languages, systems design, and minimal computing.

I care about simplicity, performance, and clarity — in code, tools, and ideas. I enjoy working on compilers, infrastructure, and developer-facing tools.

This site contains a collection of things I’m working on or thinking about. It’s intentionally minimal — no scripts, no clutter.
