# Teaching

I enjoy sharing complex ideas in a simple and intuitive way.

## Current / Recent Courses
- **Discrete Mathematics** – Fall 2024  
  Covered topics in combinatorics, logic, graph theory, and number theory.

- **Algorithms and Data Structures** – Spring 2024  
  Focused on problem solving, complexity, and practical algorithmic design.

## Teaching Philosophy
I believe in active learning, curiosity-driven exploration, and teaching through problems rather than lectures.

_Materials and notes will be posted here soon._
